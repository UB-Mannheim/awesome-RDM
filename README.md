# Awesome RDM

"Awesome Research Data Management" is  a curated list of awesome RDM resources for researchers and organizations.

## Definitions

"**Research data** are objects that you use and produce during your research life cycle, encompassing datasets, software, code, workflow, models, figures, tables, images and videos, interviews, articles. Data are your research asset." [The Turing Way / Guide for Reproducible Research / Research Data Management / Research Data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-data.html)

**Research "data management** refers to the storage, access and preservation of data produced from a given investigation. Data management practices cover the entire lifecycle of the data, from planning the investigation to conducting it, and from backing up data as it is created and used to long term preservation of data deliverables after the research investigation has concluded. Specific activities and issues that fall within the category of data management include: File naming (the proper way to name computer files); data quality control and quality assurance; data access; data documentation (including levels of uncertainty); metadata creation and controlled vocabularies; data storage; data archiving and preservation; data sharing and reuse; data integrity; data security; data privacy; data rights; notebook protocols (lab or field)." [CODATA RDM-Terminology / RDM](https://codata.org/rdm-terminology/research-data-management)

In a wider sense research data management include also research information management and research knowledge management.

## RDM for researchers

_Use case:_ a researcher wants to plan, run and finish a research project.

#### Data Management Planning

A Data Management Plan (DMP) describes how research data is handled before the project has commenced, ensuring the traceability of data during the project and beyond. DMPs are often required in a formalized form when submitting a funding application or during the project period, for example with Horizon Europe, ERC grants. The DFG also asks for information on Data Management, although this is not explicitly a DMP and the DFG.  
 
A DMP typically contains the following elements: 

- Data Description/Data Collection
- Documentation and Data Quality
- Storage and Backup
- Legal and Ethical Requirements
- Data Sharing and Archiving
- Data Management, who and what?

**DMPs and Research Funding in Germany**: 
 
DMP requirements differ depending on the funding institution within Germany (see below). 

| Funding Institution                               | DMP Requirements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | DMP Template       |

| German Research Foundation (DFG)                  | Not explicitly a DMP, but information on data management is usually required in section 2.4 of the application.

See DFG Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data. | Yes (unofficially) |
| Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) | There are no general requirements with regard to research data. The requirements are defined individually for each tender.

You may also want to consider the data management standards in your own research field (e.g., Humanities, Social Sciences, Business and Economics) which might inform what you should include in your DMP, in which case, check out the following:

- [Standardised Data Management Plan for Educational Research](https://www.forschungsdaten-bildung.de/stamp-nutzen) of the Research Data Education Network
- Research Data Management in the Social, [Behavioral and Economic Sciences, Chapter 2](https://www.konsortswd.de/aktuelles/publikation/forschungsdatenmanagement-in-den-sozial-verhaltens-und-wirtschaftswissenschaften/)

#### Data policies

(Research-) Data Policies are guidelines and recommendations for handling research data. They can be on different levels and from different actors, such as:
* Data policies of third-party funders (e.g. [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/resource/blob/172112/4ea861510ea369157afb499e96fb359a/leitlinien-forschungsdaten-data.pdf) or [ERC](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/oa-pilot/h2020-hi-erc-oa-guide_en.pdf))
* Data policies of publishers and/or journals (e.g. [American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/data-code-policy), [Oxford University Press](https://academic.oup.com/pages/open-research/research-data), other policies can be found at [ReplicationWiki](http://replication.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/index.php/Journal_publication_policies#cite_note-1))
* Discipline-specific guidelines (e.g. [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/de/grundlagen-rahmenbedingungen/grundlagen-und-prinzipien-der-foerderung/forschungsdaten/empfehlungen))
* Guidelines of research institutions (e.g. [institute-specific](https://www.forschungsdaten.org/index.php/Data_Policies#Institutionelle_Policies) and [project-specific](https://www.forschungsdaten.org/index.php/Data_Policies#Forschungsdaten-Policies_f%C3%BCr_Forschungsprojekte))

There are also tips, toolkits and other materials to help institutions and projects develop a data policy. For example, you can find materials from these projects:
* [FDMentor](https://www.forschungsdaten.org/index.php/FDMentor): [Empfehlungen zur Erstellung institutioneller Forschungsdaten-Policies](https://zenodo.org/records/3333410), [Strategischer Leitfaden zur Etablierung einer institutionellen Forschungsdaten-Policy](https://zenodo.org/records/3333392), [RISE-DE](https://zenodo.org/records/3585556)
* [LEARN](https://learn-rdm.eu/en/about/): [Toolkit of Best Practice for Research Data Management](https://learn-rdm.eu/en/dissemination/toolkit/)

* [Reusing existing data](https://www.ugent.be/en/research/datamanagement/before-research/data-reuse.htm) by Ghent University

First, find it.
* Search in a suitable data repository which you can find in [Registries](#registries).
* Search at
    * [DataCite](https://search.datacite.org)
    * [OpenAIRE](https://explore.openaire.eu/search/find)

### Finishing a project

The [difference between sharing, publishing & archiving](https://datacarpentry.org/rr-publication/01-publication) is:
* sharing: any way of sharing information, could mean also emailing. It means also making research data available throughout the research lifecycle, especially during the active research phase, typically via cloud storage.
* publishing: citable artifact, discoverable.
* archiving: long-term preservation.

#### Sharing data

There are many benefits to sharing data.

You can share the data via GitHub
